# Neural-Nets
This is one of my projects at the Recurse Center. You will find a couple of basic examples of classical neural nets using the MNIST data set for digit recognition. 
Most of my implementations rely on Michael Nielsen's book on neural networks and deep learning, and are adjusted by some additional optimizations.

The goal of this was not to optimize for the best possible performance, but to understand neural networks in depth without using additional libraries like Theano.
